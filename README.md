# Sentiment-Analysis

Overview of the Project

This project showcases a machine learning-based end-to-end sentiment analysis pipeline. In order to demonstrate proficiency in data preparation, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, the goal is to analyze Twitter text data and automatically categorize each tweet as positive or negative.

What Takes Place in This Project

Loading Data -
A Kaggle dataset is used to load Twitter sentiment data, which is then ready for analysis.

Preprocessing Text -
In order to prepare the data for machine learning, noise like stopwords, URLs, and special characters are eliminated from the raw tweet text.

Extraction of Features -
TF-IDF vectorization transforms text input into numerical form so the model can comprehend word importance.

Training Models -
To discover sentiment trends, labeled tweet data is used to train a logistic regression model.

Outcome -

The final model successfully predicts whether a tweet expresses positive or negative sentiment, demonstrating practical application of machine learning to real-world text data.
